# Deepfake Detection Using Optical Flow and CNN-Based Architectures

## Introduction

Deepfakes leverage AI to manipulate videos by altering faces, often convincingly. This project aims to detect deepfakes using both frame-level and motion-based analysis. We evaluate a 3D CNN with optical flow, and compare it against state-of-the-art image classifiers like ResNet152, Vision Transformer (ViT), and XceptionNet.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source**: Celeb-DF dataset
- **Training Samples**: 5168
  - Real: 742
  - Fake: 4426
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Videos are split into frames.
  - Frame folders are labeled in the format `id0_id2_0003`.
  - Class balance is ensured by uniform sampling.

## üß† Methodology

### 1. Frame-Based Classification

Implemented using PyTorch and [timm](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models):

- **ResNet152**: Deep CNN with skip connections.
- **ViT (vit_b_16)**: Transformer treating images as patch sequences.
- **XceptionNet**: CNN with depthwise separable convolutions.

**Training Setup**:
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: Cross-Entropy
- Epochs: 10
- Libraries: tqdm, scikit-learn

### 2. Optical Flow + 3D CNN

Designed but **not trained due to resource constraints**.

- Motion estimation via Farneback's optical flow.
- Input: 9 motion maps (u and v vectors from 10 consecutive frames).
- Model: 4 Conv3D layers + ReLU + MaxPool3D + fully connected layers.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- **ResNet152**: Best performance overall.
- **XceptionNet**: Competitive results, low error.
- **ViT**: Slightly lower performance.
- **Optical Flow + 3D CNN**: Promising direction, needs further computation and training.
